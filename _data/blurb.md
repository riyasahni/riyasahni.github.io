Hi! I am a second year Computer Science Ph.D. student at Columbia University, advised by [Dr. Lydia Chilton](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~chilton/chilton.html). My research focuses on **Human-AI Interaction** and **Agentic Systems**. 

I examine **how people collaborate with AI systems and agents** -- from how people learn and adapt to AI tools to agentic methods that improve AI *transparency* and human *intent-alignment*.

Prior to joining Columbia, I worked at **Microsoft** as a CSAM in the Financial Services Industry in New York City. I hold a B.S. in Computer Science and B.A. in Economics from the **University of Chicago,** where I was advised by [Dr. Marshini Chetty](https://www.marshini.net/) and [Dr. Sarah Sebo](https://sarahsebo.com/).

*I am grateful to be supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program).*
